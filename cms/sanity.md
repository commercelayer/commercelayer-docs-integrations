# Sanity

[Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io) is a developer-oriented headless content management system that powers better digital experiences, empowers teams of all sizes with content management, real-time collaboration, advanced version control, and more. One of the outstanding features of Sanity is the [Sanity studio](https://www.sanity.io/studio), which is an open-source content management system that offers rapid configuration, reusable structured content, a comfortable editor, real-time collaboration, toolkits, plugins, and more features to enable you to create the best content workflow.

Sanity improves the quality and value of online shopping experiences by allowing businesses to create, maintain, and compose product data with marketing content. There is no successful ecommerce business without content, and the content itself is one delicate component of ecommerce that must be handled independently with great care by content experts on a headless content management system. Sanity provides businesses with the tools they need to manage content effectively and decentralize content efforts in an engineering team.

With Sanity, developers can build ecommerce experiences with any stack or technology of their choice, utilize commerce APIs like Commerce Layer, create raw content, reuse it on any channel, and transform any boring catalog into rich content that will result in more conversions and revenue \[...]
